A couple of simple scripts that make a picture appear and a random song play when the player fully spawns.

Yay! My first (proper) GitHub repository! I probably won't delete this one.

So! Let me introduce myself: I'm Postino/djosepaci/coolbananadrivingacoolmotorcycle2 and I'm trying to become a successful programmer.

This is my first decent project, it's not that much (BUT IT'S MINE) and it actually works and doesn't need any more work.

I managed to get things done thanks to a friend, also. Thanks friend.

**Yadda yadda yadda, but how does this work?**
The addon supposedly works like this:
* you join the server
* a picture pops up on your screen
* cool (randomly chosen) music plays in your headphones
* the picture slowly fades out
* the music ends

That's it! It's not much, but I'm quite proud of it because I finally learnt how to (mainly) use net-messages and draw.

Hopefully there's more to come, see you!
